After graduating with my BS in Math from [Cornerstone University](https://www.cornerstone.edu/), my wife [Jenn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jennifer-prather/) and I moved to the Bay Area for me to attend the University of San Francisco's [Master of Data Science program](https://www.usfca.edu/arts-sciences/graduate-programs/data-science). We love it here, though I can't deny that I miss my Midwest roots. 

My academic background is in Math and Design, while I've worked in Data Science and Software Engineering. I'm interested in developing novel solutions to solve real-world problems.
