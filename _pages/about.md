After studying Math at Cornerstone University, I moved to the Bay Area to attend the University of San Francisco's [Master of Data Science program](https://www.usfca.edu/arts-sciences/graduate-programs/data-science). Upon graduation, I joined [Immuta](https://www.immuta.com/) as a Data Scientist.

My academic background is in Math and Design, while I've worked in Data Science and Software Engineering. I'm interested in developing novel solutions to solve real-world problems. Feel free to reach out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/collin-prather/), or contact me directly at collin.prather742@gmail.com! 

Here's a short list of things I've been learning about lately:

- [Numpyro](https://github.com/pyro-ppl/numpyro)
- Causal Inference
- [Gelman's](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.01808.pdf) and [Betancourt's](https://betanalpha.github.io/assets/case_studies/principled_bayesian_workflow.html) take on a Bayesian model-building workflow
- [Meltano](https://meltano.com/) (open-source ELT)
- [Argo Workflows](https://argoproj.github.io/argo-workflows/)
